# Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a _classic_ cellular automaton, and is turing complete. Watch evolution unfold based on a set of rules. 

### Rules
- Live Cells:
    - If has fewer than 2 neighbors: dies from underpopulation
    - If has greater than 3 neighbors: dies from overpopulation
- Dead Cells
    - If exactly 3 live neighbors: alive via reproduction
